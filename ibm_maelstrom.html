        <p>Finishing my senior thesis project, <a href="#" target="_blank">Borrow Presence</a>, I had a strong feeling that I needed to learn how to focus on users’ needs, intent and pain points. Even though I knew about the methods and theory behind UX research after reading many articles and books like <a href="#" class='italic' target="_blank">UX Research</a>, I was curious about how user research is applied in the real-world. Therefore, I decided to apply for an internship program where I could learn about user research. I remembered when IBM Design visited our campus to talk about IBM Design Thinking, which focused on human-centered outcomes. Therefore, I applied for an UX Research Intern position at IBM Design, where I could make the most UX research impact on the users.</p>
        <p>When I received an unexpected phone call from Maelstrom Program Lead, Devin O’Bryan, I was ecstatic to engage with professional researchers and designers. With excitement, I moved to Austin, where I joined the Equinox 2016 Maelstrom team along with 14 other interns including UX researchers, UX designers, visual designers and front-end developers.</p>

          <p>Our four-person team included a UX researcher(me), a UX designer, a visual designer, and a front-end developer who worked on a project called, “AMANDA.” (aka. Amazing M AND A) We were committed to find better communication solutions for IBM M&A users. Our main focus was to streamline the acquisition process at IBM.</p>

        <div class="text">
          <p>In the first week of our AMANDA project, we had a rough time understanding our users’ needs. We especially experienced confusion and ambiguity in understanding the whole merger and acquisition process and its terminology. At the end of every interview, we felt like we were in a long dark hole.</p>
          <p>However, we spent hours and hours to ask questions and explore the problems. We   opened up to critique and gave honest feedback to each other to align ourselves. We often walked outside or explored Austin together to share our honest feelings. This whole experience not only strengthened our connection but also helped us to connect with our users. At the end, we could merge our findings into a convincing solution that could cut two months off the average IBM’s proactive acquisition processing time, which carried the projected value of one billion dollars. Also, engaging with difficult questions with the users and being open to critique helped me see things differently and deeply as a UX researcher.

        <div class="text">
          <p>For every weekly presentation, known as Playback at IBM, we had to present our findings to our stakeholders with a compelling story. At first, our team struggled to synthesize our findings and describe our insights into a story. However, as our story developed, we realized it leveraged our thoughts with feelings and communicated the right message to our stakeholders. The relationship and plot built around our persona, Bobbi, helped to focus on the experience and the users. Also, our stakeholders could empathize with Bobbi’s conflicts and could understand our potential solutions.</p>
          <p>Being able to convey our meanings and intentions to the stakeholders, we could also receive meaningful feedback from our stakeholders. Either they agreed or disagreed, we could have ongoing conversation about the pros and cons of our ideas. It was a unique experience for me, because we always had “Bobbi” appear in our discussion and we could picture what “Bobbi” might experience, feel or even do in a situation.</p>

        <p class="subtitle"><strong>3. Design System is more than a design library</strong></p>
        <div class="text">
          <p>Before experiencing and hearing a story behind IBM Design Language, I didn’t know how much a design system can make a huge difference in our design process and deliverables. It was more than a cohesive design library that everyone uses to bring a consistent user experience. Throughout the design process, the design system helped me to communicate with people in other roles. Also, it allowed our team to express and make a distinction in our product at scale.</p>
          <p>In fact, when I worked as a full-time UX designer at TmaxOS, I noticed the communication and inconsistent design problems between designers and developers. Therefore, I shared my experience at IBM with my manager and team members. My manager asked me to lead the Tmax Design System team to fix the level of inconsistency and fragmentation within TmaxOS products. Before I left the company, our team managed to establish the first shared library with visual language and UI components.</p>
