        <p>At the University of Michigan, new students often struggle to understand the nature of the student organizations in a process of searching and browsing both online and offline. After conducting user interviews, as well as usability tests, I have identified three major problems in centralizing, discovering and understanding online information. With more than 1,400+ student organizations at Michigan, online information is outdated and scattered across many different platforms. Therefore, I designed a hub where new students can explore and discover their future student clubs, with aggregated images and posts from social media, and can pitch their new student group ideas.

      <div class="col-12 col-md-6 text">
        <p>Before taking any design process steps, I thought it was crucial to align myself with the context and the objective of the design exercise. First, I assumed I was designing for the Orientation Team from Office of New Student Programs, so I could use all accessible resources around me.
        </p>
        <p>On the next step, I identified who I was designing for. Even though 70% of 9,500 total new students are undergraduates at Michigan, I didn’t limit myself to just designing for the new undergrads. Therefore, I decided to go deep into <strong>all incoming undergrad, master’s, and PhD students at the University of Michigan</strong>.

      <div class="w-100"></div>
      <div class="col-12 col-md-6 text">
        <p>After identifying my users, I decided to conduct user interviews instead of surveys. Even though I knew I could gain a lot of data in a short time frame with surveys, I needed a deep understanding of users’ experiences in searching and proposing new student clubs. Therefore, I set up 6 user interviews: 2 from undergrad, master’s, and PhD programs.
        </p>
        <p>During my interviews, I asked questions primarily focused on <strong>understanding a journey from being admitted to Michigan, the first day of orientation, to discovering and proposing new student organizations of their interests</strong>. I thought it was important to get a full scope of experiences behind searching for new student groups. Therefore, I decided to begin my questions from being admitted to Michigan. Also, I went deeper with any frustrations and challenges they have encountered during their journey with follow-up questions.

        <p>After conducting five user interviews (one master’s interviewee dropped out due to illness), I took my time to listen to all of voice recordings of the interviews. Then, I began synthesizing and grouping overlapping findings and problems along the user journey. Every interviewee had a different but unique experience, but I was able to identify two overarching problems within a process of searching and proposing new student organizations.

        <p>Usability testing was the most critical and most challenging step during this exercise. After brainstorming, sketching, and creating low fidelity screens using Sketch, I needed to validate if I had correctly aligned with users’ needs. Therefore, I invited back 3 users from the previous interviews and conducted usability tests using InVision.</p>
        <p>The usability tests primarily focused on validating the concept and the workflow of searching, browsing, and proposing organizations.</p>

        <ul class="lists">
          <li>Interviewees appreciated how they could see upcoming events of all student organizations, since they sometimes make decisions by checking what activities the organizations are doing.</li>
          <li>Interviewees saw a meaningful value with unique hashtags. When they had to hunt down photos or posts uploaded before, the hashtags allowed them to see all the activities and visual cues in a centralized place.</li>

        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Negatives:</strong></p>
        <p>There were a lot of negatives about this prototype. However, among all the negative feedback, I want to focus on this quote from one of the usability tests:</p>
        <div style="margin: 2em 0 2em 0;">
        <p style="font-style:italic;"><strong>“It is like Medium. Do you ever go to Medium to search for an article? You find it through Twitter, Facebook or something that someone has shared with you. It is same and secret to get attention from somewhere else.”</strong><figcaption style="text-align:right;">– interviewee 2, a master’s student at the School of Information.</figcaption></p>
        </div>
        <p>At first, I didn’t quite get what she was trying to say. However, I realized how my prototype has no reason or no strategy for the users to come back or get redirected to the web page. My biggest challenge was to get users to actively use this platform, so it becomes a living creature. However, I saw my prototype as just being another dead plant that could be outdated and could lack in information, like MaizePages. Therefore, when I faced this huge wall, I knew I had to step back and find missing pieces.</p>

        <p>After realizing the value of unique hashtags and the challenge in making my solution stay active, I stepped back and re-evaluated my interviews to find missing pieces. After listening to my recordings and synthesizing them again, I realized I was moving in the wrong direction. There was nothing wrong with my insights, overarching problems, and my problem statement. However, my design goals were too board and weren’t deeply touching the basis of user needs. Also, it was the moment I realized I tried to do everything fast in order to finish this exercise on time. Therefore, I took my time to rework on my design goals. And, finally to use a metaphor, I was driving a car with the right tires in the right direction.

        <p>One thing I learned over many years is the importance of making a consistent design that can embrace all different types of screens. Since I was designing for both mobile and web users, I had to make a small design system with foundation of typography, color, icons, and buttons sizes. I followed Perfect Fourth Scale (1.333) for the stability in type scale. I also tried to combine the identity of the University of Michigan and the identity of my application, which is a beehive. Then, I decided to use Icons from Material Design, which are already well established for all different platforms.</p>

          <p>One of the biggest challenges I encountered during this exercise was to stay focused on the mainstream of experience that users need but stay away from questions I could not answer. Even though it was only a week-long design exercise, I had a lot of questions raised in my mind. How can I handle the privacy issue? What is the better way to arrange SNS images and posts on the “Discover” page? If I were to actually develop this application, how I can promote it? Do I need a permission from the university? How should users interact with a mobile version? Even though I wanted to add more features on my application, I stayed on user insights and moved on according to <a href="files/planning.pdf" target="_blank">my plan</a> to finish on time.</p>
          <p>Also, I wanted to understand how student organizations are managed. Therefore, I visited <a href="https://campusinvolvement.umich.edu/about" target="_blank">The Center for Campus Involvement</a> who manages over 1,400 student organizations across the campus. However, I couldn’t get any opportunities to meet and chat with the staff members in a short time frame. Even though I was confident with the decisions I made throughout the process, it was tough to stay away from going further and diving deeper into my curiosity and questions I couldn’t answer.</p>
          <p>Overall, this exercise was an opportunity to check how far and how deep I could go in a week. Also, I felt thankful to have this chance to be a part of 2019 Google Design Challenge.</p>
