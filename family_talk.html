        <p>In an aging population, many current mobile messaging applications are not suitable for users 60 or older, who often find smartphones difficult to use. Addressing elderly users’ physical and cognitive problems such as a blue-yellow colorblindness and a decline in hand-eye coordination, I have created a messaging mobile application called Family Talk. It is an app designed to help close the communication gap between the older and younger generations.

      <div class="w-100"></div>
      <div class="col-12 col-md-6 text">
        <p>In 2018, 2 billion people are using mobile messaging applications worldwide.(<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/483255/number-of-mobile-messaging-users-worldwide/" target="_blank">1</a>) Using a messaging app, we can now communicate with others using text, video and voice. Among these methods, 62 percent of users aged 18 to 29 prefer texting as a main communication tool. However, only about 33 percent of users 50 or older would communicate using text. Also, almost two thirds of users 50 or older selected voice as the most preferred mobile communication method.(<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/740374/mobile-communication-preference-usa-age/" target="_blank">3</a>)
        </p>
        <p>However, most messaging applications are designed for younger users rather than older users, even though users 50 or older make up more than 20 percent of all smartphone users. The design and the experience the current messaging applications offer do not meet their needs. Moreover, with their decline in physical and cognitive abilities, we should start considering more accessible messaging applications for users 50 or older. Especially when they are typing on a small keyboard or understanding and adapting to the difference in interactions among the different apps, older users simply give up on using a smartphone. Also, there are a lot of different types of messaging applications, but the existing applications are simply not designed for older people. Therefore, older generations often are left out and the communication gap between the older and younger generations deepens.</p>

    <section class="row justify-content-center" id="section">
      <h3 class="col-12 col-md-6 header">Interviews</h3>
      <div class="w-100"></div>
      <div class="col-12 col-md-6 text">
        <p>Before conducting interviews, I set up two groups of target users. My primary target was a group of the older generations who have difficulties in using smartphones but want to communicate with the younger generations in the family. The second was a group of people in the younger generations, who want to communicate with their grandparents but have a hard time catching up with them due to grandparents’ limited ability to use a smartphone.
        </p>
        <p>Based on my target groups, I conducted four initial interviews to find out the needs and problems users are facing with current messaging applications. Therefore, I interviewed two people from a 50 or older age group and two from an 18 to 29 age group. A female interviewee in her 70s was a grandmother of two grandchildren and only uses a home phone to communicate with her grandchildren. A male older adult was a grandfather of ten grandchildren and a retired philosophy professor, who managed to learn how to use smartphones. I also interviewed a student and a full-time worker who are in their 20s and use messaging applications to text and communicate every day.
        </p>
        <p>The interview questions focused on understanding their needs and problems in communicating with the older/ younger group of people. Also, I wanted to understand their methods of communication and their experience in using the mobile messaging application experiences.

        <ul class="lists">
          <li>The older male interviewee likes to chat in text, because getting a message feels like hearing a news update. However, he prefers talking on the phone, because it is easier to feel the emotions with hearing ‘voices.’</li>
          <li>One surprise I got from the interviews was that all the interviewees enjoy sending GIF images. They store GIF images sent by their grandchildren and reuse those images whenever they talk to someone, because GIF images help to express and convey meanings with visuals.</li>
          <li>I realized that the older adults can use messaging applications like any other users. However, when it comes to communicating with people other than their family members, they would talk on their phones rather than text. They do not want to make any “efforts” to find and type on tiny keyboards on the screen, because of their physical constraints. Also, the elderly users don’t want a new application that requires to learn new kinds of interactions. However, if the app can leverage their experience in communicating with their grandchild, they will try to learn and use it.</li>

Also, the younger interviewees share more of their story, because the older audiences prefer to listen to their grandchild’s story.</li>
          <li>Also, one of interviewees expressed an interesting insight. He told me that he wouldn’t want to download another messaging application on his phone, because his phone doesn’t have enough space for another application.</li>

      <div class="w-100"></div>
      <div class="col-12 col-md-6 text">
        <p>From the initial interviews, I realized accessibility is a key aspect. All the interviewees are aware of the older age group’s physical and cognitive constraints, which make it difficult for them to use some essential features such as using a keyboard to send a message. However, addressing the fact that the older age group wants to express their feelings, I found out that a new communication method that can address older generations’ physical and cognitive abilities is needed for the target users. Also, I needed to address the fact that younger users may not want to download another application in their phone.
        </p>
        <p>Therefore, I decided to deliver a highly accessible communication tool for elderly users who have difficulties in using smartphones but want to communicate with the younger generations in the family. Also, I decided to address the fact that they like to communicate with visuals and sound rather than with texts. I tried to create a bridge between the instant messaging, which the younger audiences prefer and the visual texting, which the older interviewees liked. Lastly, I planned to design a messaging application that sends directly to a default messaging inbox in each phone such as iMessage. Therefore, it doesn’t require everyone in a family to download another application.

        <h3 class="header">Approach</h3>
        <p>Addressing older users’ limited physical and cognitive abilities, I decided to focus heavily on accessibility. Therefore, I started with research on elderly users’ changes in health that cause challenges for smartphone use before making any design decisions.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Changes in Vision</strong></p>
        <div class="text">
          <p>One of the inevitable declines in our physical abilities as we get older is the changes in our perceptions. From in their 40s, people start to experience presbyopia or long-sightedness, which makes difficult to focus on close-up objects.(<a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/what-is-presbyopia" target="_blank">4</a>) Also, elderly users can experience a decline in color sense. For instance, up to 45 percent of people in their mid-70s can be affected by a blue-yellow colorblindness or tritanopia.(<a href="https://consumer.healthday.com/senior-citizen-information-31/misc-aging-news-10/color-vision-tends-to-fade-with-age-study-685767.html" target="_blank">5</a>) Therefore, I had to address that elderly users find it challenging to distinguish between blue and yellow colors and to read small and low contrast colored text.

          <p>As we age, our physical and perceptual changes can affect our hand-eye coordination. The neurological changes influence our perception of surrounded spaces and objects and cause “deficiencies in performing goal-directed hand movements.”(<a href="https://source.wustl.edu/2013/06/older-adult-clumsiness-linked-to-brain-changes/" target="_blank">6</a>) Therefore, I had to consider the size of buttons and spaces in between to address elderly users’ hand-eye coordination problems.

        <h3 class="header">Initial Sketches</h3>
        <p>For my initial concept, I focused on finding a new method of communication that accommodates the users in their 50s+. Therefore, I primarily focused on interactions and work flow that the older users might find intuitive and can easily adapt. Considering beyond the functionality of keyboard, I decided to pursue three major forms of communication that do not require “goal-directed hand movement.”
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Larger Text</strong></p>
        <div class="text">
          <p>Considering physical and cognitive constraints of my target users, older generations who have a limited mobile experience, I decided to add a feature, which helps to toggle between original text size to larger text size. One kind of feedback I got from the interviews was that the older user had a hard time finding a setting option where they can adjust the text size of messages. Therefore, I created a “Large Text” button right on chatrooms. By simply pressing “Large Text” button, the older users can enlarge texts without changing the setting of their phone.

        <div class="text">
          <p>Based on the feedback I got from my target audience and peers, I decided to exclude a keyboard function and tried to think beyond keyboard interactions. One approach I took was a “Voice” function. The users simply have to press and hold the “Voice” button to record and send a voice message to their family members.

        <div class="text">
          <p>One great piece of feedback I got from the potential user was the “Write” function. He said that he would want to “write” messages without typing, because he often had a difficult time finding certain letters from the keyboard. Therefore, I create a space where the users can write with their fingertips to send written messages. Going off from this idea, I also created a “Draw” mode, where people can also draw their own emojis. From my interviews, the users like to use emojis on a communication app, because it helps them to convey their feelings. Therefore, in order to create a meaningful conversation and increase the level of engagement in the conversation, I decided to use “Voice”, “Write” and “Draw” as my main media to send messages.

          <p>One insightful piece of feedback I got from peers was that I should consider the possibility of an emergency situation. My target users, older generations, might encounter a medical emergency. Therefore, I decided to add a feature, which allows the users to contact their family members. Initially, I had an emergency contact icon on the Home screen. However, I got some feedback from my target audiences explaining it is hard to unlock the screen and find the icon to contact the family members. Therefore, I created a simple and highly accessible emergency button on the Lock screen, where they just have to swipe to send an automatic message. Also, considering any mistakes they might make, I set the message to be sent 5 after seconds they swiped.

        <p>With the short paper prototype video, I interviewed four interviewees from previous interviews to validate my concepts.

        <p class="subtitle"><strong>What Worked Well</strong></p>
        <div class="text">
          <p>Mainly focusing on the level of engagement in a conversation and accessibility, the “Write” and “Draw” modes stood out the most. Being able to avoid any searching or pressing a tiny keyboard button, my potential users appreciated this feature the most. Even if they might have a physical constraint, they said writing and drawing is more accessible and easier for them to convey their feelings. Especially, one mentioned that since they are more used to write than type, this approach made better sense for them. Also, the “Emergency” feature was also considered a success. Even though they do not know how many times they would use it, having a highly accessible emergency button on the very first screen of their phone gives them a psychological relief.
          </p>
          <p>Also, I have to debate whether to exclude or include the keyboards. Many users mentioned that they would still want to have keyboards somewhere on the chatrooms, because they still would use it in some cases.

          <p>Since I got some great insight from talking to the potential users on the “Write” and “Draw” functions, I wanted to expand on these two functions. Also, I wanted to give more flexibility on the “Draw” mode. Since it was meant to convey different feelings with drawings, I considered adding a function, which allows to select different colors.
          </p>
          <p>Also, I decided to expand on the “Emergency” function. I reworked this particular function to be reliable, so the users can set up multiple emergency contacts.

Also, based on whether “Large Text” feature is on or not, the communication tool bar in the chatroom changes. On a small text size mode, the communication tool bar offers “Keyboard” as their primary communication tool and “Call”, “Write and Draw,” “Emojis” as their secondary. However, on a large text mode where most older users would use, “Write and Draw” becomes the primary and “Call,” “Keyboard,” and “Emojis” are offered as the secondary communication method.

          <p>When I was designing a messaging application for the users in their 50s or older, the color was one of my biggest challenges. Focusing on older users’ long-sightedness and tritanopia, I had to explore different colors that satisfy the WCAG contrast ratio standard of 4.5: 1 and consider colorblindness especially in a blue-yellow spectrum. After thoughtful evaluation, I decided to use these three colors as my primary colors:

          <p>Addressing changes in coordination and proprioception as we get old, I explored to create the right button sizes and spaces in between buttons for easier interaction. Based on research(<a href="https://hillside.net/plop/2012/papers/Group%201%20-%20Elk/Target%20and%20Spacing%20Sizes%20for%20Smartphone%20User%20interfaces%20for%20Older%20Adults%20-%20Design%20patterns%20Based%20on%20an%20Evaluation%20with%20Users.pdf" target="_blank">7</a>) on target sizes and spaces for elderly smartphone users, I found that if a target size is 14 mm (52.9 px) with 3.5 mm (13.2 px) spaces in between two targets, the accuracy rate was the highest with almost 100% and the time to complete an action was also the fastest. Therefore, I decided to create a button size of 55 pixels and 25 px spaces in between.

        <div class="text">
          <p>We are living in a world where 77% of US population has or uses a smartphone. 94% of 18-29-year-olds and 89% of 30-49-year-olds own a smartphone, while only 46% of 65 or older people use a smartphone.(<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/483255/number-of-mobile-messaging-users-worldwide/" target="_blank">8</a>) Many have adopted the smartphones and use mobile messaging applications to communicate each other. However, even though we see there a high number of smartphone users in the 65 or older group, the elderly people still find it difficult to use a smartphone. Especially, using the current mobile messaging applications, which is the main purpose to use a smartphone, is not easy for the older generations.
          </p>
          <p>From this project, I realized that not many mobile applications address older adults’ challenges to use the applications. Therefore, as a user experience designer, I strived to accommodate to all users and make apps accessible as much as possible. Focusing on users’ needs and constraints, I valued and believed that the accessibility was the key to success for this project. Addressing elderly users’ physical and cognitive constraints such as changes in vision and coordination, I made important design decisions on accessibility, such as user interfaces and workflows. Also, I challenged myself to explore and to deliver a new communication method for elderly users that can convey meaning and provide easier interactions other than typing on a tiny keyboard. Family Talk is not just a solution to help close the communication gap between the older and younger generations within a family, but also an application that everyone can use.
