      <div class="col-12 col-md-6 text">
        <p>In downtown Ann Arbor, Sweetwaters Coffee & Tea is one of the well-known local coffee shops where many students, professors and local residents spend their time to study, relax and connect. The cafe offers fresh, tasty and distinct coffees to enjoy. However, a better customer experience had to be established to motivate the customers to visit regularly.
        </p>
        <p>Therefore, our four-person team <strong>aimed to leverage Sweetwaters’ customer experience in order to lure the customers back into the coffee shop</strong>. Also, we focused heavily on our research to find a meaningful interaction that can establish a connection between the customers and Sweetwaters Coffee & Tea.

      <div class="col-12 col-md-6 text">
        <p>An initial survey helped our team to understand the aspects that lure coffee regulars to revisit a certain coffee shop and helped to set students as our target users. Also, we conducted interviews with a group of students to understand their needs, as well as a group of baristas at Sweetwaters and one of the owners of Sweetwaters to identify the gaps between the business strategy and the users’ needs. The findings from the survey and the interview led to a specific design direction, which delivered a new ordering experience and a personalized interaction for the users.

      <div class="col-12 col-md-6 text">
        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Initial Survey</strong></p>
        <p>First, our team had to understand the motivation toward revisit intentions and the characteristics of coffee regulars. Therefore, we decided to conduct a survey, which consisted of questions asking for their habits and patterns in coffee shops. We asked questions related to their visit regularity, their interaction experience at local coffee shops, and their most important quality in the coffee shop.
        </p>

      <div class="col-12 col-md-6 text">
        <p>After collecting the 82 responses from our survey, we could align ourselves with some interesting facts:
        </p>
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>The main purpose of visiting a coffee shop is just to buy coffee (40.3%) or to do work (29.9%)</li>
          <li>52 out of 82 people order the same coffee, when they are revisiting a certain coffee shop.</li>
          <li>66.7% of our responses said small talk with baristas gives a good impression of the coffee shop</li>
          <li>The quality of products (77.2%) mattered the most for the consumers. Also, the availability of spaces (57%) and accessibilities (50.6%) such as Wi-Fi motivated people to revisit</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, we discovered that <strong>people want to drink high-quality coffee, which makes them revisit to have the same coffee</strong>. Further, a favorable interaction between the customer and the barista helps to build a positive connection with the coffeehouse.

      <div class="w-100"></div>
      <div class="col-12 col-md-6 text">
        <p>The survey results were collected from students (50%), working students (31.9%) and Full-time workers (12.5%). Since our team recognized that the majority of customers are students, we decided to focus on the students.
        </p>
        <p>Also, we had to identify a “Why” factor such as Sweetwaters’ distinct story: specialties or owners’ motivation that can make a connection with the customers. Therefore, we chose to align ourselves with the workers at Sweetwaters to understand the foundation and the distinct aspect of the brand that could lure people into the coffee shop.

        <p>Understanding the user story at Sweetwaters, we were able to discover insights beyond what we found from the survey:
        </p>
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>The quality of coffee is the key factor to decide which coffee shop to go. However, when the customers are busy, the speed of coffee matters the most. Since they always have one or two same order in their mind, it is sometimes frustrating to wait in line.</li>
          <li>The friendliness or the politeness of the workers help them decide whether they want to have a conversation with the baristas or even coming back.</li>
          <li>The customers appreciate the distinct drinks Sweetwaters offer, but do not know why and how they are made.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, we discovered that people want to drink high-quality coffee, which makes them revisit to have the same coffee. Further, a favorable interaction between the customer and the barista helps to build a positive connection with the coffeehouse.

        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Business: Sweetwaters Coffee & Tea Baristas and Owner</strong></p>
        <p>In order to find out the “Why” factor of Sweetwaters, we asked for interviews with the workers at Sweetwaters. Thankfully, we gained an opportunity to talk with two baristas and one of the co-owners of Sweetwaters. Also, our team focused on understanding business strategies and constraints to learn the perspectives of the business side.
        </p>
        <p>Understanding the business perspective, we discovered some significant insights from the baristas:
        </p>
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>Most complaints are on the customers’ personal preference on pastries or coffee. Also, they sometimes encounter some cranky customers when in a rush.</li>
          <li>They sometimes offer friendly suggestions on new products if they are looking at the menu.</li>
          <li>Most customers order for take-out, but customers who stay mostly work.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="w-100"></div>
      <div class="col-12 col-md-6 text">
        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Also, through the owner, we could understand what and how was built around the brand, Sweetwaters:</strong></p>
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>The owner thinks consistency of their products is the key to get the business going. Therefore, they spend a lot of time and effort selecting the coffee and teas. Also, Baristas must take online tests about products to keep consistency in the products.</li>
          <li>Our team also heard a distinct story from the owner. The owners travel to China and Japan to select specific teas, such as premium tea. Using those teas, they established their own hand crafted artisanal drinks for the customers. Also, in order to improve their products, the owners work very closely with their roaster to come up with special blends just for them.</li>
          <li>They are willing to learn and are open to customer feedback. Therefore, they read suggestion boxes and Yelp reviews to understand what they need to improve.

      <div class="col-12 col-md-6 text">
        <p>Synthesizing the interviews and the survey, our team could identify some overlapping insights and problems. First, Sweetwaters has a distinct brand and product story, but the message was not being conveyed to the customers. Even though the owners have traveled to China and Japan to make their own specialized drinks, the story was not being promoted to the customers. Also, we found the ordering experience has to be improved, especially in the rush hours where customers turn away or experience stress with the baristas.
        </p>
        <p>Aligning the needs of users and business, we defined our project goal to satisfy both the users and the business. Among all the opportunities we found, our team believed these two important findings can make the biggest impact on the customer experience and can help to increase the number of regulars. Therefore, our team decided to <strong>deliver a solution that can promote Sweetwaters’ distinct story to connect with the customers and improve ordering experience to motivate the customers to revisit</strong>.

        <p>Keeping the three key factors in mind, our team brainstormed and ideated fifty concepts. We took our time to discuss and revisit our concepts. We looked at the pros and cons and the concepts that are relevant to all of our focus groups. After hours of discussion, we narrowed them down to eight concepts that effectively meet the needs.

        <p>To explore and validate the concepts more in depth, our team invited four customer interviewees. To get objective feedback, we interviewed two customers from Sweetwaters and other two who go to other coffee shops. To help our interviewees better understand our concepts, we sketched a short storyboard with a scenario to feel for their emotions.

        <p>Considering how the potential users felt about our concepts, the concepts with positive feedback were heavily dedicated to the customer ordering experience.
        </p>
        <p>Therefore, we decided to create <strong>a smart system that provides customers with a personalized interaction by knowing their preferences and thereby creating a more seamless experience</strong>. The smart system included a mobile application for customers and an accompanying system for the business with a point of sale system and display for customers.
        </p>
        <p>Our smart system presents customers with a personalized menu and encourages new product adoption. Also, it allows the barista to provide a more pleasant and taylor-made customer experience.
