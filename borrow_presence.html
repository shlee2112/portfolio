        <p>Borrowed Presence simulates the presence of a person who has a meaningful relationship with the user in order to combat the loneliness inherent in one-person households. It uses light to reproduce the silent presence of a significant person in order to lessen the user’s psychological and emotional vulnerability, while respecting their privacy.

      <div class="w-100"></div>
      <div class="col-12 col-md-6 text">
        <p>After my elementary school graduation in Korea, I started my student life in Canada at the age of eleven. Living without my parents and younger sister, I strived to overcome the loneliness I faced every day. However, even after more than ten years passed, I still couldn’t manage to overcome it but could only adapt to it. The darkness and the sound of the refrigerator always resided in the empty spaces in my room. There were simply no other presences that could fill up my room.
        </p>
        <p>Running into these problems every day, I always had an interest in how lonely people with similar conflicts manage their loneliness. What exactly makes us lonely? What helps to fill up the emptiness in our chest? What kind of connections do we need in life to feel less lonely? To answer these questions, I decided to impact the loneliness inherent in one-person households for my senior thesis project.

        <div class="text">
          <p>First, I had to understand if there is a specific group of people who are living alone like me. Also, I searched for the reasonings behind it. Therefore, I started my project by asking myself, “What kind of people are living alone and what has led them to live alone?”</p>
          <p>Through secondary research, I found out that the notion of family was considered very important and valuable before the 21st century. However, as capitalism started to make people richer and raised the standard of living, the value of family began to lessen.(<a href="https://truthout.org/articles/living-alone-the-rise-of-capitalism-and-the-decline-of-families/" target="_blank">1</a>) Also, due to urbanization, advanced technology, the development of the Internet, and the rise in global female employment, people started to choose to live alone.(<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/living-alone-youre-not-the-only-one" target="_blank">2</a>)</p>

        <div class="text">
          <p>Also, I found that in 1970 there were only 17% of Americans living alone(<a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/numbers/one-in-four-american-households-is-one-person-living-alone-1696/" target="_blank">3</a>), but today, one in four Americans lives alone both intentionally and unintentionally. People in their 20s and 30s are pushing back or even avoiding marriage to enjoy their life without any disruption, and the elderly are left alone when their partner passes away. This shift has created a feeling of loneliness for singles, not just locally but also globally. Therefore, through my research, I decided to set two focus groups for my project: a group of singles in their 20s and 30s, and a group of elderly people without a partner.</p>

        <p>With two focus groups set, I was able to reach out and do ten interviews, seven with singles in their 20s and 30s and three with singles in their 50s. With their thoughtful answers, I could find out some key factors that make people feel lonely. Synthesizing my findings through interviews and secondary research, I could break down two key pain points: loneliness by technology, and space.</p>

        <div class="text">
          <p>The British anthropologist Robin Dunbar’s theory, “Dunbar’s number,” states the average maximum number of stable, cohesive people that an individual can keep a social contact with is 150.(<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/mar/14/my-bright-idea-robin-dunbar" target="_blank">4</a>) Also, it states that each person has a core group of three to five special people with the highest intensity of relationship. Also, the author of “Going Solo,” Eric Klinenberg, a professor of Sociology at NYU, wrote that loneliness is not decided by the quantity of people but by the quality of people with whom we interact. However, the current environment of advanced technology, expansive nature of social network services, pressure toward quantity over quality online, as well as a tendency to develop social relationships digitally have magnified and deepened people’s sense of being alone.(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/opinion/sunday/how-not-to-be-alone.html?_r=0" target="_blank">5</a>)

        <div class="text">
          <p>As the number of single person households is increasing, singles tend to get a defined private space and a defined public space. Private space indicates home and public space signifies shared space and time. The biggest difference between these two spaces is the vulnerability of the person.(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/opinion/sunday/how-not-to-be-alone.html" target="_blank">5</a>) In our own space, we can be vulnerable and can be ourselves at home, whereas a public space is exposed and is a place where people wear masks that they have created and what the self has created. Before, singles had the support of their family even at home when they had personal concerns. However, now there is no one to confide in or no one to be vulnerable or rely on in same space; they have to find or call someone who can support them.

          <p>Following this trend, an inevitable cultural tectonic shift has happened, sharing culture.

        <div class="text">
          <p>I remembered a documentary film about Korean traditional architecture. It talked about the idea of borrowed scenery, which is an architectural term used in Korean traditional houses. Rather than have paintings on wall, borrowed scenery utilizes windows to capture and frame nature beyond. Since the landscape was more dynamic and realistic, it helped people to evolve their sensibility. Therefore, I decided to implement this idea of borrowed scenery to capture the silent presence. I named my product, Borrowed Presence.

        <h3 class="header">Design Concept</h3>
        <div class="text">
          <p>To make this concept possible, I decided to design my product as an ambient device. An ambient device uses calm technology that allows to initiate the interaction based on her needs, rather than the technology providing the information push.(<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1057063" target="_blank">7</a>)
          </p>
          <p>Also, it engages both the center and the periphery of our attention, and in fact moves back and forth between the two.(<a href="http://www.ubiq.com/weiser/calmtech/calmtech.htm" target="_blank">8</a>) Through the movement of the users, only light that corresponds to the silent presence fills up the space and is shown from the product. Since home is where people get time to relax without a constant and endless feedback from the connected products, the product doesn’t require any actions from the users. Therefore, only deep, constant and appreciated connection is present silently in the space.
          </p>
          <p>Therefore, Borrowed Presence uses an ambient light, which represents the silent presence of another person, to fill the space with brightness and to blend into the room. It was designed to preserve privacy while presenting the presence in the user’s environment.

        <div class="text">
          <p>For the technical part, I developed and programmed using C code to make Arduino work. For the scenario, A LED is user A’s frame and B LED is user B’s frame. And, as A moves toward A’s frame, which is attached with B’s ultrasonic, B’s frame gets brighter. Simply saying, as A moves toward the frame, the presence of A shows on the B’s frame.

          <p>The hardest part of making the product was hiding the ultrasonic sensor, which needs to be exposed to detect the proximity of the user. Since I didn’t want to make my product as a “high-tech” looking product that hinders sentimental feelings, I had to make it not visible.

          <p>Designing an additional corner frame allowed me to carry many different details without downgrading any of my concepts.

          <p>I designed the frames that look simple but include hidden details inside. They were designed to slide a frame mat, two glasses into the frame and to hold them together. Also, they include slots for LEDs. I used a frame mat to help the light to bounce back and forth and to block the users from seeing the LEDs inside. Having a trail of inner space around the frame, I attached LEDs around the frame and covered it with sand blasted glass to diffuse the LED lights.

        <p class="subtitle"><strong>1. How Internet of Things can deliver a positive impact in our daily life.</strong></p>
        <div class="text">
          <p>I gained much more knowledge about why Internet of Things can be so powerful in our daily life. From this project, I saw how connected products can immerse into our space and time without interfering the users. This helped me to realize how we will be able create a new experience that really matters for the people. Since they can be seamlessly integrated in our routine, the connected products will help us to capture users’ unconscious behavior, natural interaction and daily dialogue. Also, the valid data we collect will be real time data, which can create a huge impact on the improvements and future decisions.
          </p>
          <p>Also, when we are designing a new product, we focus on a group of people. However, with the data from individuals, we will be able to create a personalized experience that fits just the specific person. Therefore, every interaction, connection and experience we deliver will be much more meaningful and delightful for them.
          </p>
          <p>From this experience of making an interconnected product, I was fascinated by how Internet of Things can make a positive impact on our lives. And now, I am pushing my limit to create my own IoT product.

        <p><strong>2. Establishing right questions defines the design of product.</strong></p>
        <div class="text">
          <p>Since I didn’t know much about contextual inquiry or research methods, I had some challenges to come up with great questions. At first, my questions were too broad or specific that unintentionally created confusions or constraints. Noticing the restrictions, I have in my research skills, I read a lot of blogs, articles and books like UX Research by Brad Nunnally & David Farkas to understand the breadth of research and to prepare for the next interviews. Using the guidelines and logistics from the readings, I brainstormed and iterated to polish my questions. Therefore, I managed to ask right questions that helped me to obtain some new perspectives and insights. The whole research process was a valuable experience that helped to establish my fundamental research skills. Also, it triggered me to gain an interest in user research, which pushed me to apply for an internship where I could gain <a href="ibm_maelstrom.html">a real-world research experience.</a>
