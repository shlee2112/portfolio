        <p>For the Summer 2019, <strong>I sought a unique internship opportunity where I could prosper as a UX designer who can collaborate with new technology to deliver meaningful interactions</strong>. Therefore, I applied for a UX design intern role at Google, which I believed could offer me a unique experience. Thankfully, I received a call from Pritam Pebam, my intern host, and learned about what he and Google Lens team could offer. <strong>The project was about creating a new transit experience using machine perception and AR (Augmented Reality) capabilities</strong>. As a person who was always interested in how artificial intelligence could leverage our daily life, I was extremely thrilled to learn about this unique opportunity. Therefore, I expressed my excitement to my intern host. For the Summer 2019, I flew to Mountain View, California and spent 3 months interning as a UX designer with my Google Lens team at PR55.</p>

        <p class="subtitle"><strong>1. Collaboration starts from small talk and opens up new possibilities</strong></p>
        <div class="text">
          <p>One of my biggest takeaways was the Googlers. With such an open and collaborative culture, I was able to build a relationship with 40+ different Googlers with different expertise and teams. Talking and discussing with many different Googlers, I realized that small talk is very crucial in a professional world. Casual conversations during lunch or social events didn’t seem significant. In fact, it was like planting a seed, and they helped me to open up new opportunities. When I was stuck with a problem, I was able to reach out to a particular Googler who could provide me with expert feedback. Also, starting from small talk, I was able to establish connections with Googlers in different offices, such as New York and Tokyo. This eventually led to establishing a cross-functional team network within our team and creating an opportunity to travel to the New York office to leverage our product.</p>

        <p class="subtitle"><strong>2. Prioritization and talking to the experts help handle ambiguities and challenges</strong></p>
        <div class="text">
          <p>At the start of my project, there were a lot of ambiguities in our problem scope and approach. Therefore, I proactively reached out to many Googlers in different teams to gain more understanding from different perspectives. From their feedback, I was able to understand their design challenges and how their approach to solve the problem. By understanding the constraints and limitations of each product, I could measure the values that only Lens could provide for the users. From this experience, I realized the power of sharing culture, which can not only help make a better decision but also draw a borderline to focus on the right problem.</p>

        <p class="subtitle"><strong>3. Understanding the audience and utilizing visuals help better communicate my intent and insights</strong></p>
        <div class="text">
          <p>Throughout my internship, I strived to leverage my presentation skills to clearly communicate the intentions and purposes of my deliverables. After watching many Googlers’ presentations, I learned that understanding the audience is crucial. Depending on their interests, they might want to see a specific feature or a whole experience from my deliverables. Therefore, understanding their expectations helped me to be flexible to change the format of my deck. Another significant lesson I learned was the importance of delivering the key points by utilizing visuals. From the presentations I watched, I noticed that Googlers are extremely good at using visuals to aid their words. Therefore, when I was creating my deck, I carefully chose images and gifs that could support my idea.</p>

        <div class="text">
          <p>As the current technology trends in AR and artificial intelligence are flourishing, my internship was a great opportunity to learn about the capabilities and limitations of the new domains. From this experience, I could develop my interest in AR and AI even more. Therefore, I decided to continue exploring and researching how I can use these superpowers to provide useful information in a real-context, as well as superpowers to utilize computer vision.</p>

          <p>My internship experience with the Google Lens team was incomparable with other UX experiences I had throughout my career. This is especially true, because of all the Googlers I met during my internship. When I asked for a coffee chat or a meeting to get some feedback, not even one person said “no.” This amazing experience helped me grow not only as a designer but also as a person and a collaborator. I will always remember every single one of the Googlers I met. I especially want to thank my thoughtful intern host, Pritam for offering me this amazing journey at Google.</p>
